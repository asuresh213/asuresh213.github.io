          <p><img style="padding: 10px; float:left;" width="250" height="250" src="/about/index/myface.jpg"> Hi! I’m Arun, a math PhD student at University of Missouri. I got my B.S and M.S. in math (it was a dual degree program) from Georgia State University, where I mainly focused on commutative algebra (My master’s thesis was concerned with finding the Betti numbers of a certain numerical semigroup ring). I am originally from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xhN3hzCmSo">Chennai</a>, a coastal city in South India, and I moved to the U.S. in the fall of 2016. In my time at GSU, Besides academics and research, I served as the President of its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pin.gsu.edu/organization/math-stats-club-at-gsu">Mathematics and Statistics club</a>, and the founder (and president) of The Continuum Group – a sister organization to MathStat club, dedicated towards competitive problem solving, aimed towards creating GSU’s first ever Putnam team. The group represented GSU in it’s first ever Putnam competition in 2019.</p>
<p>This blog was an impulsive reaction to this stunning <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://grossack.site/">blog</a> of a user that I just happened to come across in MSE one fine day. So I am not quite sure where this is headed; and there certainly isn’t any grand plan (although I am quite enjoying doing this!). I want to use this blog as a place to record my thoughts, and talk about the cool math that I find online, or in general read about over the course of my PhD program.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, it has always been true that the more I teach and express my thoughts; the better my understanding of the subject becomes. Often times, at a PhD level, especially with self teaching various subjects, one is unable to find a whole lot of other people to torment (either because they are in the same class as you – and thus just as lost, or they have their plates full; or they just know the subject already). It is also the case that a lot of graduate level textbooks are quite dense and cryptic in writing; especially if one is self-teaching without dedicated guidance of a class or a mentor. This is true especially if the subjects in question are highly abstract and require an extensive background in allied subjects to begin with.</p>
<p>On more philosophical terms, there is also a fundamental disconnect in contemporary society and its view towards pure mathematics being “recreational” or “without application” (at least, anecdotally). The following quote by Henri Poincare captures really what I feel about this  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mathematician does not study pure mathematics because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it and he delights in it because it is beautiful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This blog is my way of seeking some compromise in all of those issues. In trying to understand tricky (and important) theorems or ideas, I will try and make a post about it (and I will try to stay as close to the ground with it as possible) so that future students could read it and gain something out of it. In doing so, (if I dare say) I would like to inspire some appreciation for pure mathematics, and of the beauty that lies at the heart of an elegant argument.</p>
