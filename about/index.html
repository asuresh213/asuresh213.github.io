          <p><img style="padding: 10px; float:left;" width="250" height="250" src="/about/index/myface.jpg"> Hi! I’m Arun, a math PhD student at University of Missouri. I got my B.S and M.S. in math (it was a dual degree program) from Georgia State University, where I mainly focused on commutative algebra (My master’s thesis was concerned with finding the Betti numbers of a certain numerical semigroup ring). I am originally from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xhN3hzCmSo">Chennai</a>, a coastal city in South India, and I moved to the U.S. in the fall of 2016. In my time at GSU, Besides academics and research, I served as the President of its <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pin.gsu.edu/organization/math-stats-club-at-gsu">Mathematics and Statistics club</a>, and the founder (and president) of The Continuum Group – a sister organization to MathStat club, dedicated towards competitive problem solving, aimed towards creating GSU’s first ever Putnam team. The group represented GSU in it’s first ever Putnam competition in 2019.</p>
<p>This blog was an impulsive reaction to this other stunning <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://grossack.site/">blog</a> of a user that I just happened to come across in MSE one fine day. So I am not quite sure where my blog is headed; and there certainly isn’t any grand plan (although I am enjoying the process of figuring that out as I go!). I want to use this blog as a place to record my thoughts, and talk about the cool math that I find online or read about over the course of my PhD program.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, it has always been true that the more I teach and express my thoughts on a certain subject or topic; the better my understanding of it becomes. Often times, at a PhD level, especially with self-teaching various concepts, one is unable to find other people to torment (at least, anecdotally). It is also the case that a lot of graduate level textbooks are quite dense in writing (I am looking at you <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://59clc.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/real-and-complex-analysis.pdf">Prof. Rudin</a>, and you as well <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/aconstant/Alg2/Bib/Hartshorne.pdf">Prof. Hartshorne</a>); especially if read without the dedicated guidance of a class or a mentor. Understanding certain ideas and notions in higher mathematics also becomes quite challenging if the subjects in question are highly abstract and require an extensive background in allied subjects to begin with.</p>
<p>From a philosophical standpoint, I also believe that there is (a subtle but) fundamental stigma in contemporary society in its view towards pure mathematics being “recreational” or “without application” (again, anecdotally). The following quote by Henri Poincare captures very succinctly how I feel about and approach pure mathematics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mathematician does not study pure mathematics because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it and he delights in it because it is beautiful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This blog is my way of seeking some middle ground in all of those issues. In trying to understand tricky (and important) theorems or ideas, I will try and make a post about it (in which I will try to stay as close to the ground with it as possible) so that future students could read it and gain something out of it. In doing so, (if I dare say) I would also like to inspire some appreciation for pure mathematics, and of the beauty that lies at the heart of an elegant argument.</p>
